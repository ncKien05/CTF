# Overview
When entering the website, a login page appears

**Hint 1:** What IP does the server think youâ€™re coming from?  
**Hint 2:** Read more about [X-forwarded-For](https://www.typeerror.org/docs/http/headers/x-forwarded-for)  
**Hint 3:** You can rotate fake IPs to bypass rate limits.  

The challenge is to provide us with an email and a list of passwords  
Email: ctf-player@picoctf.org  
Password: [Download here](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_amiable_citadel/f7976d25bf2051cdee03f24a92791f4116c6eaf4ab5d7542462535051265613c/passwords.txt)  
It seems like the web forces us to find the correct password in this list  
Now I will try to log in with a few passwords

If you enter the wrong password twice, you will have to wait 20 minutes, which is terrible  
It seems like the IP is what helps the web realize we're trying to bruteforce

Flag will be returned
